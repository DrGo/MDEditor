##MDEditor Swift Package: Progress Summary & Next Steps
### Progress So Far:
Package Setup & Core Architecture:
The MDEditor Swift package has been created, targeting macOS 15+ and iOS 18+.
It correctly depends on swift-markdown for core GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) parsing.
We've opted for a single-module structure for simplicity.
Markdown Parsing & Rendering Engine (MarkdownContentRenderer.swift):
Utilizes swift-markdown to parse raw Markdown strings into a Document (Abstract Syntax Tree). GFM features are parsed by default.
MarkdownContentRenderer has been implemented. This struct conforms to MarkupVisitor from swift-markdown and traverses the parsed Document tree.
It successfully converts the Document into an NSAttributedString, applying various styles.
Cross-Platform Styling: Platform-agnostic typealiases (MFont, MColor, MFontDescriptor) are in place, enabling MarkdownContentRenderer to handle fonts and colors for both UIKit (iOS) and AppKit (macOS).
Configurable Styles: A MarkdownContentRenderer.StyleConfiguration struct allows customization of baseFontSize, baseFontName, layoutDirection, list indentation, blockquote appearance (italicization, indent), and various colors. This struct is Equatable for use with SwiftUI's onChange modifier.
The renderer applies these configurations to style headings, paragraphs, lists (ordered/unordered with nesting), code blocks, inline code, blockquotes, emphasis (italic), strong (bold), links, and strikethrough text.
SwiftUI Editor View (MDEditorView.swift):

MDEditorView is the primary SwiftUI component, taking a @Binding to the raw Markdown text.
It manages the editor's mode (.view or .edit) and the currentStyleConfiguration as @State variables.
View Mode: Displays the rendered Markdown as a SwiftUI AttributedString (converted from the NSAttributedString output by MarkdownContentRenderer).
Edit Mode: Uses a standard SwiftUI TextEditor. For macOS, we've incorporated MacOSTextEditorView (an NSViewRepresentable) to gain access to the underlying NSTextView for more reliable Undo/Redo functionality.
Caching: Implements a basic NSCache for NSAttributedString to optimize performance by avoiding re-rendering of unchanged content.
Toolbar Interface:
Mode switcher (View/Edit).
Writing direction toggle (LTR/RTL), which updates currentStyleConfiguration.layoutDirection.
"Font Options" menu:
Allows choosing a font name using the system font picker (UIFontPickerViewController on iOS via IOSFontPickerRepresentable, and NSFontManager on macOS).
"Clear Editor" button.
"Copy All" button (copies the raw Markdown text).
Undo/Redo buttons (functional in edit mode).
Platform-specific toolbar item placements are handled.
The view correctly responds to changes in text, style configuration (including layout direction, font size, font name) by re-rendering.


What Is Left To Do:
Refine Styling and Theming: styling in View mode depends on markdown elements; in Editor mode it is simple text editor styling
Redesign the styling interface to allow the user to apply a theme to the entire document that controls the styling of each markdown element in View mode, eg font characteristics; color, paragraph/line spacing options etc
Font Application in Edit Mode: control the editors font name and size (for all the text) perhaps using a settings icon.
macOS Font Panel Integration: Fully wire up the font selection from NSFontPanel on macOS to update currentStyleConfiguration.baseFontName and baseFontSize in MDEditorView. This involves robustly handling the changeFont(_:) action from NSFontManager within MacOSTextEditorView.Coordinator and propagating the changes back to the SwiftUI state.

Themes: Implement a mechanism for predefined style themes.
Enhance Markdown Feature Support in MarkdownContentRenderer:
GFM Tables: Implement visitTable, visitTableRow, and visitTableCell to correctly render tables.
Images: Implement visitImage to handle image display (e.g., using NSTextAttachment or exploring SwiftUI Image embedding if feasible within AttributedString).
Task Lists: Add rendering support for GitHub-style task lists (- [ ], - [x]).
HTML Handling: Define a clear strategy for rendering or stripping raw HTML blocks and inline HTML.


Right-to-Left (RTL) and Internationalization (Core Logic in Place, Needs Polish):
Thorough RTL Testing: Conduct extensive testing with mixed Arabic/Latin text, focusing on list numbering/bullet alignment, blockquote rendering, and overall text flow in RTL mode.
Edit Mode RTL: Ensure cursor behavior, text selection, and input are natural and correct in RTL mode within the TextEditor.
Localization: Localize any user-facing strings within the editor's UI (e.g., tooltips, menu items if not using system symbols/defaults).
Front Matter (Postponed Feature):
Implement YAML front matter parsing.
Integrate storage and access to front matter data.
Design and implement UI for viewing/editing front matter in edit mode.

API, Performance, and Usability Polish:
API Review: Finalize the public API of MDEditorView and StyleConfiguration for clarity, ease of use, and sensible defaults.
Error Handling: Enhance error handling, particularly for parsing or AttributedString conversion failures, providing feedback to the developer or user if appropriate.
Performance Optimization: Stress-test with very large Markdown documents. Optimize parsing, rendering, and caching logic if any performance bottlenecks are identified. Consider if background processing for rendering is needed.
Accessibility: Review and ensure good accessibility for the editor components.
Documentation and Examples:
Write comprehensive developer documentation for the MDEditor package, covering integration, customization via StyleConfiguration, and API usage.
Provide clear usage examples, potentially expanding the demo app.
Testing:
Develop unit tests for MarkdownContentRenderer to verify correct NSAttributedString output for various Markdown inputs.
Consider UI tests for MDEditorView interactions.



## MDEditor Swift Package: Progress Summary & Next Steps
This document outlines the current state of the MDEditor Swift package and the tasks remaining for its completion.

Progress So Far:
The MDEditor package has made significant strides, establishing a solid foundation for Markdown editing and rendering within SwiftUI applications.

1. Core Architecture & Setup:
* The Swift package targets macOS 15+ and iOS 18+.
* It utilizes swift-markdown (GitHub Flavored Markdown by default) for core parsing.
* A single-module structure (MDEditor) is in place.
* Platform-specific code has been largely isolated into separate files (e.g., MacOSEditorComponents.swift, IOSEditorComponents.swift).
* Platform-agnostic typealiases (MFont, MColor, MFontDescriptor) are used for cross-platform compatibility in rendering.

2. SwiftUI Editor View (MDEditorView.swift):
* MDEditorView is the primary SwiftUI component, taking a @Binding to the raw Markdown text.
* Manages .view and .edit modes.
* Edit Mode:
* Uses MacOSTextEditorView (an NSViewRepresentable wrapping NSTextView) on macOS for robust text editing and Undo/Redo.
* Uses IOSEditorTextView (a UIViewRepresentable wrapping UITextView) on iOS for enhanced control over text editing.
* The appearance of the editor in Edit Mode is configurable via an MDEditorConfiguration object, which is passed as a @Binding from the host application. This allows the host to control font, colors, line spacing, and layout direction.
* View Mode:
* Displays rendered Markdown.
* The rendering is driven by MarkdownContentRenderer.
* Toolbar:
* Provides mode switching (View/Edit).
* Includes a consolidated LTR/RTL toggle button that affects the active mode (View or Edit).
* Basic actions like "Clear Editor" and "Copy All" (raw Markdown).
* Undo/Redo buttons for Edit mode.

3. Markdown Rendering Engine (MarkdownContentRenderer.swift):
* Parses raw Markdown into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using swift-markdown.
* Implements MarkupVisitor to traverse the AST.
* Advanced Theming System (View Mode):
* MDEditorTheme.swift: Defines a comprehensive theme structure, including global settings (font, colors, layout direction) and element-specific styles.
* MarkdownElementStyle.swift: Defines granular style properties (font, color, traits, paragraph settings) for individual Markdown elements.
* HexColor.swift: A robust, Codable struct for parsing HEX color strings (including shorthand) from theme files.
* TextDirection.swift: A Codable enum (ltr, rtl) for type-safe layout direction in themes and configurations.
* MarkdownContentRenderer is now initialized with an MDEditorTheme object.
* It features a style resolution mechanism that applies styles with a fallback order: theme's element-specific style -> theme's default element style -> internal default theme's specific style -> internal default theme's default style.
* All visit... methods are being refactored to use this new theme-driven style resolution.
* Caching: A basic NSCache is used for NSAttributedString (keyed by Markdown text only, with cache clearing on theme/style change).

4. Theme Loading:
* MDEditorView accepts an optional themeURL from the host application.
* If a themeURL is provided, MDEditorView attempts to load and parse the YAML theme file from that URL.
* If no themeURL is provided or loading fails, it falls back to an initialTheme (which defaults to MDEditorTheme.internalDefault).
* The host application is responsible for discovering theme files and providing the URL of the selected theme.

5. Platform Abstraction:
* MDEditorPlatformActions protocol and platform-specific structs (MacOSPlatformActions, IOSPlatformActions) abstract Undo/Redo and Copy operations.

What Is Left To Do:
While the core theming structure is in place, significant work remains to fully leverage it in the renderer and to complete other features.

1. Finalize Theme-Driven Rendering in MarkdownContentRenderer:
* Complete visit... Methods: Ensure all visit... methods in MarkdownContentRenderer correctly and comprehensively use the resolved MarkdownElementStyle from the active MDEditorTheme to apply all defined attributes (fonts, colors, paragraph styles, decorations, etc.) to the NSAttributedString.
* Pay special attention to complex elements like lists (indentation, marker styling), blockquotes (recursive styling), and tables.
* Refine style inheritance for nested elements (e.g., a link within a heading).
* Test MColor.fromHex and Font Utilities: Confirm these are robust and all themed colors/fonts are applied as expected.

2. macOS Font Panel Integration (for editorConfiguration):
* Fully wire up the NSFontPanel on macOS (when invoked for Edit Mode) to update the bound editorConfiguration's editorFontName and editorFontSize. This involves ensuring MacOSTextEditorView.Coordinator.changeFont(_:) correctly modifies the binding.

3. macOS Font Panel for View Mode Theming (Advanced):
* Investigate and implement a mechanism for the macOS Font Panel to update the activeTheme in MDEditorView when in View Mode. This could involve:
* Modifying global font properties of a copy of the activeTheme.
* Making MDEditorView (or a helper object) a responder to changeFont(_:) actions.

4. Enhance Markdown Feature Support in MarkdownContentRenderer:
* GFM Tables: Implement visitTable, visitTableRow, and visitTableCell to correctly render tables using themed styles.
* Images: Enhance visitImage. Currently a placeholder link. Consider rendering actual images using NSTextAttachment (for NSAttributedString) or exploring SwiftUI Image embedding if feasible within the attributed string context. The theme could specify image alignment, max size, etc.
* Task Lists: Add rendering support for GitHub-style task lists (- [ ], - [x]). Consider interactivity (allowing clicks to toggle state, which would modify the raw Markdown).
* HTML Handling: Define and implement a clear strategy for rendering or stripping raw HTML blocks and inline HTML. The theme could specify how these are handled (e.g., display as a styled code block, strip, or attempt basic pass-through).

5. RTL and Internationalization Polish:
* Thorough RTL Testing: Conduct extensive testing with mixed Arabic/Latin text in both View and Edit modes, focusing on list numbering/bullet alignment, blockquote rendering, code block alignment, and overall text flow.
* Localization: Localize any user-facing strings within the editor's UI (e.g., tooltips, menu items if not using system symbols/defaults).

6. API, Performance, and Usability Polish:
* API Review: Finalize the public APIs of MDEditorView, MDEditorConfiguration, MDEditorTheme, MarkdownElementStyle, HexColor, and TextDirection for clarity, ease of use, and sensible defaults.
* Error Handling:
* Enhance error reporting for theme loading in MDEditorView (currently prints to console, could use the themeLoadingError state more visibly or offer a callback).
* Implement an error callback mechanism in MDEditorView for parsing or NSAttributedString conversion failures.
* Performance Optimization: Stress-test with very large Markdown documents and complex themes. Optimize parsing, style resolution, rendering, and caching logic if bottlenecks are identified.
* Accessibility: Review and ensure good accessibility for all editor components.

7. Documentation and Examples:
* README.md: (Generated in a separate step).
* Developer Documentation: Write comprehensive inline documentation (DocC) for all public types and methods.
* Demo App: Enhance the demo application to showcase all features, including theme selection from various sources, dynamic editor configuration changes, and all supported Markdown elements.

8. Testing:
* Unit Tests: (Generated a starting set in a separate step).
* Expand tests for MarkdownContentRenderer with various themes to verify correct NSAttributedString output for all Markdown inputs and element styles.
* Test MDEditorTheme and MarkdownElementStyle decoding with more complex and edge-case YAML.
* Test HexColor and TextDirection parsing more extensively.
* UI Tests: Consider UI tests for MDEditorView interactions if a suitable testing framework/approach is identified for package UI.

9. (Postponed) Front Matter:
* Implement YAML front matter parsing.
* Integrate storage and access to front matter data.
* Design and implement UI for viewing/editing front matter.

This list provides a clear roadmap for future development, building upon the robust theming and configuration systems now in place.
