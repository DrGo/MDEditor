##MDEditor Swift Package: Progress Summary & Next Steps
### Progress So Far:
Package Setup & Core Architecture:
The MDEditor Swift package has been created, targeting macOS 15+ and iOS 18+.
It correctly depends on swift-markdown for core GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) parsing.
We've opted for a single-module structure for simplicity.
Markdown Parsing & Rendering Engine (MarkdownContentRenderer.swift):
Utilizes swift-markdown to parse raw Markdown strings into a Document (Abstract Syntax Tree). GFM features are parsed by default.
MarkdownContentRenderer has been implemented. This struct conforms to MarkupVisitor from swift-markdown and traverses the parsed Document tree.
It successfully converts the Document into an NSAttributedString, applying various styles.
Cross-Platform Styling: Platform-agnostic typealiases (MFont, MColor, MFontDescriptor) are in place, enabling MarkdownContentRenderer to handle fonts and colors for both UIKit (iOS) and AppKit (macOS).
Configurable Styles: A MarkdownContentRenderer.StyleConfiguration struct allows customization of baseFontSize, baseFontName, layoutDirection, list indentation, blockquote appearance (italicization, indent), and various colors. This struct is Equatable for use with SwiftUI's onChange modifier.
The renderer applies these configurations to style headings, paragraphs, lists (ordered/unordered with nesting), code blocks, inline code, blockquotes, emphasis (italic), strong (bold), links, and strikethrough text.
SwiftUI Editor View (MDEditorView.swift):

MDEditorView is the primary SwiftUI component, taking a @Binding to the raw Markdown text.
It manages the editor's mode (.view or .edit) and the currentStyleConfiguration as @State variables.
View Mode: Displays the rendered Markdown as a SwiftUI AttributedString (converted from the NSAttributedString output by MarkdownContentRenderer).
Edit Mode: Uses a standard SwiftUI TextEditor. For macOS, we've incorporated MacOSTextEditorView (an NSViewRepresentable) to gain access to the underlying NSTextView for more reliable Undo/Redo functionality.
Caching: Implements a basic NSCache for NSAttributedString to optimize performance by avoiding re-rendering of unchanged content.
Toolbar Interface:
Mode switcher (View/Edit).
Writing direction toggle (LTR/RTL), which updates currentStyleConfiguration.layoutDirection.
"Font Options" menu:
Allows choosing a font name using the system font picker (UIFontPickerViewController on iOS via IOSFontPickerRepresentable, and NSFontManager on macOS).
"Clear Editor" button.
"Copy All" button (copies the raw Markdown text).
Undo/Redo buttons (functional in edit mode).
Platform-specific toolbar item placements are handled.
The view correctly responds to changes in text, style configuration (including layout direction, font size, font name) by re-rendering.


What Is Left To Do:
Refine Styling and Theming: styling in View mode depends on markdown elements; in Editor mode it is simple text editor styling
Redesign the styling interface to allow the user to apply a theme to the entire document that controls the styling of each markdown element in View mode, eg font characteristics; color, paragraph/line spacing options etc
Font Application in Edit Mode: control the editors font name and size (for all the text) perhaps using a settings icon.
macOS Font Panel Integration: Fully wire up the font selection from NSFontPanel on macOS to update currentStyleConfiguration.baseFontName and baseFontSize in MDEditorView. This involves robustly handling the changeFont(_:) action from NSFontManager within MacOSTextEditorView.Coordinator and propagating the changes back to the SwiftUI state.

Themes: Implement a mechanism for predefined style themes.
Enhance Markdown Feature Support in MarkdownContentRenderer:
GFM Tables: Implement visitTable, visitTableRow, and visitTableCell to correctly render tables.
Images: Implement visitImage to handle image display (e.g., using NSTextAttachment or exploring SwiftUI Image embedding if feasible within AttributedString).
Task Lists: Add rendering support for GitHub-style task lists (- [ ], - [x]).
HTML Handling: Define a clear strategy for rendering or stripping raw HTML blocks and inline HTML.


Right-to-Left (RTL) and Internationalization (Core Logic in Place, Needs Polish):
Thorough RTL Testing: Conduct extensive testing with mixed Arabic/Latin text, focusing on list numbering/bullet alignment, blockquote rendering, and overall text flow in RTL mode.
Edit Mode RTL: Ensure cursor behavior, text selection, and input are natural and correct in RTL mode within the TextEditor.
Localization: Localize any user-facing strings within the editor's UI (e.g., tooltips, menu items if not using system symbols/defaults).
Front Matter (Postponed Feature):
Implement YAML front matter parsing.
Integrate storage and access to front matter data.
Design and implement UI for viewing/editing front matter in edit mode.

API, Performance, and Usability Polish:
API Review: Finalize the public API of MDEditorView and StyleConfiguration for clarity, ease of use, and sensible defaults.
Error Handling: Enhance error handling, particularly for parsing or AttributedString conversion failures, providing feedback to the developer or user if appropriate.
Performance Optimization: Stress-test with very large Markdown documents. Optimize parsing, rendering, and caching logic if any performance bottlenecks are identified. Consider if background processing for rendering is needed.
Accessibility: Review and ensure good accessibility for the editor components.
Documentation and Examples:
Write comprehensive developer documentation for the MDEditor package, covering integration, customization via StyleConfiguration, and API usage.
Provide clear usage examples, potentially expanding the demo app.
Testing:
Develop unit tests for MarkdownContentRenderer to verify correct NSAttributedString output for various Markdown inputs.
Consider UI tests for MDEditorView interactions.
